R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.

R2.4 Translating math expressions to Java.
    s = s0 + v0*t + 0.5*g*Math.pow(t,2)
    FV = PV * Math((1 + INT/100),YRS)
    G = 4*Math.pow(Math.PI,2) * Math.pow(a,3)/(Math.pow(p,2)*(m1+m2))
    c = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a,2) + Math.pow(b,2) - 2*a*b*Math.cos(gamma))

R2.7 Understanding integer operations, order of precedence, and integer division.
    a. 8
    b. 1
    c. 17
    d. 17.5
    e. 17
    f. 18

R2.14 How the compiler interprets primitive values
    2 is integer, 2.0 is double, '2' is character, "2" is a string and "2.0" is another string. Integer can only
    perform operations among integer numbers while float can deal with number with decimal digits. 2.0 is more
    precise than 2 since it has one decimal digit. Math operations can not be performed among string and character.
    string is a class while character is a primitive type and string is an array of character. "2.0" is a string
    that is longer than "2".

R2.17 Pseudocode understading
    String name = "DASDA WQE AE";
    String[] parts = name.split(" ");
    for (int i=0; i< parts.length;i++){
        print(parts[i,0]);
    }

R2.22 More pseudocode - you do not need to draw a diagram for this question
    4 * 3 = 12
    12 + 3 = 15
    "SunMonTueWedThuFriSat"[12:15] = "Thu"
    The result is "Thu".

R3.19 Pseudocode for grade problem
    if(Grade < 60)
        letterGrade = "F"
    else if (Grade < 70)
        letterGrade = "D"
    else if (Grade < 80)
        letterGrade = "C"
    else if (Grade < 90)
        letterGrade = "B"
    else
        letterGrade = "A"
    print(letterGrade)

R3.30 Boolean expressions
    a. false
    b. true
    c. true
    d. true
    e. false
    f. false
    g. false
    f. false

R4.12 Implementing loops
    Java supports for loop, while loop and do while loop.
    We use for loop when we need to make some operations for a certain number of times.
    We use while loop when we need to make some operations until some requirements meet. We will first cehck the requirement
    and then make an operation.
    We use do while loop also when we need to make some operations until some requirements meet. We will first make
    an operation and then check the requirement.

R4.14 Calendar problem
    weekday = "Su  M  T  W Th  F Sa"
    println(weekday)
    print("          ")
    for (int i=1; i<=32; i++)
        print(i)
        if (i % 7 == 4)
            System.out.println()
            if(i == 4)
                System.out.print(" ")
        else
            if(i<9)
                System.out.print("  ")
            else
                System.out.print(" ")
