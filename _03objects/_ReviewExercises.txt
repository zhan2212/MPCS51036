R8.1 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is to wrap up the variables and methods together as a single class, The process of providing a public
interface, while hiding the implementation details.
It is useful because some data and methods can be hidden from users.


R8.4 Public interface
Public interface is a class consists of all methods that a user of the class may want to apply to its objects.
Implementations are hidden from users while public interfaces are visible.


R8.7 Instance versus static
Instance method are the methods that you invoke on an object.
The static methods are the methods a class defines that are not invoked on an object. they belong to the class itself.


R8.8 Mutator and accessor
Mutator is the public interface that modifies the object on which it operates.
Accessor is the public interface that queries the object for some information without changing it.


R8.9 Implicit parameter
The implicit parameter is the object on which an instance method is applied.
The explicit parameter is the parameter that is explicitly mentioned in the method declaration.


R8.10 Implicit parameter
An instance method has only on implicit parameter. A static method does not have a implicit parameter.
An instance method can have multiple explicit parameters.


R8.12 Constructors
In java, a class can have 65535 constructors. A class can have no constructor. The constructor that matches the
arguments that you supply can get called.


R8.16 Instance variables
Private instance variable can only be accessed by the methods in its class.


R8.19 The this reference
In a method, the this reference refers to the implicit parameter.
Call can be easier to understand when you use the this reference.


R8.20 Zero, null, false, empty String
Zero is a certain value.
Null means the object reference refers to no object at all.
False is a boolean value.
Empty string refers to an object with value of 0.
